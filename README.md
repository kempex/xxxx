# Diabetes-with-streamlit
  This project helps to predict the diabetes of a patient by analysing their no.of pregnencies, glucose level, Blood pressure, Skin thickness, Insulin, Body mass index, Diabetes pedigree function and age of the patient.
  
  I have trained the data using RandomForestClassifier and also I have integrated it with a webpage using *STREAMLIT*.

**To run the code**

Step-1 Download the python file.

Step-2 Type "streamlit run {file path}" in the terminal.

  The streamlit will open your browser and display the output.
